# USB Thing for STM32 Blue Pill Boards

Just a homemade USB HID stack for the STM32F103C8 using the standard peripheral library plus some additional register definitions and macros for the USB peripheral.

Clone the repo and open the .ebp file in [Embitz] to compile. 

**Todo:**
- [ ] Clean up code so as to be less embarrassing
- [ ] Generate Makefile for non-Embitz users
